The German word Unheimlich is often mistranslated as ‘unhomely’; a more appropriate translation is ‘unconcealed’, ‘unhidden’, or ‘un-secret’. Freud defines it using words taken from the philosopher Friedrich Schelling as an experience of something which ‘ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light’.
