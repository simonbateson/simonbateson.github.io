Die Ringe des Saturn: Eine englische Wallfahrt - An English Pilgrimage is a 1995 novel by the German writer W. G. Sebald. Its first-person narrative arc is the account by a nameless narrator (who resembles the author in typical Sebaldian fashion[1]) on a walking tour of Suffolk. In addition to describing the places he sees and people he encounters, Sebald discusses various episodes of history and literature which attach in some way to the larger text.
